# Python Problem Create Solving Word Cloud

## Problem Statement

You'll create a "word cloud" from a text by writing a script. This script needs to process the text, remove punctuation, ignore case and words that do not contain all alphabets, count the frequencies, and ignore uninteresting or irrelevant words. A dictionary is the output of the calculate_frequencies function. The wordcloud module will then generate the image from your dictionary.
For the input text of your script, you will need to provide a file that contains text only. For the text itself, you can copy and paste the contents of a website you like.
